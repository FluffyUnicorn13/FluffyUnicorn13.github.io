            <h3>SoftWare Engineering</h3>
            <p>This course is focused on formal methods and approaches used in the design, development, testing and maintenance of computer software. 
                Each stage of the software development life cycle (SDLC) will be studied in detail. Topics such as low-level design, high-level design,
                modeling with UML (Unified Modeling Language), iterative development models, rapid application development (RAD), formal testing methods, 
                incremental deployment, formal metrics, as well as appropriate use of associated tools will be covered with practical applications.</p>
            <h4>Main Project:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We had one main project in this class, it was a group project. Our group decided to make a

            <h3>Html5</h3>
            <p>This course focuses on designing and coding internet web pages using HTML5. The student will develop web pages by designing, entering, 
                and testing code using this standard (with a simple text editor) rather than by using web development tools. 
                Topics include - HTML5 element structure, web forms, multimedia, style sheets (CSS3) to apply formatting and layout characteristics 
                in addition to applying special effects. This course will also include an introduction to the JavaScript programming language.</p>
