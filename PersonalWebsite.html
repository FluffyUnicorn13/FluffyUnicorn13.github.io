    <h1><strong>Hello Lovelies!</strong></h1>
    <p> My Name Is Debbie...</p>
    <p>
        I'm not very good at talking about myself, but I'll give this a try. I'm 32, and the youngest of four siblings (two sisters and a brother).
        I have five beautiful nieces, ranging from 21 all the way down to 2 years old. They are each beautiful and unique in their own way.
        I have an adorable and spoiled little dog named Amelia. She stays on your lap and begging for pets or she's sleeping somewhere cuddled up.
        I also have an axolotl, which is a salamander thats stay in the adolescent (tadpole) stage. She looks like a PokeMon.
