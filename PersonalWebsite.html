    <h1><strong>Hello Lovelies!</strong></h1>
    <p> My Name Is Debbie...</p>
    <p>
        I'm not very good at talking about myself, but I'll give this a try. I'm 32, and the youngest of four siblings (two sisters and a brother).
        I have five beautiful nieces, ranging from 21 all the way down to 2 years old. They are each beautiful and unique in their own way.
        I have an adorable and spoiled little dog named Amelia. She stays on your lap and begging for pets or she's sleeping somewhere cuddled up.
        I also have an axolotl, which is a salamander thats stay in the adolescent (tadpole) stage. She looks like a PokeMon. I love all things cute 
        and small. 
        I'm currently attending OCC to obtain an associates degree in SoftWare Engineering, with hope of going on and gaining a bachelors degree in a 
        more specific field. I am taking two classes this semester HTML5 and Software Engineering.

    <p><strong>My Happy Things:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/r7x6bbp4"> Miley Cyrus- Endless Summer Vacation</a>
            <p>I am a huge Miley fan, with her two newest albums being my favorite. This is her newest album, 
                which you can tell came from her heart.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3ppb9v2v"> Chanda Hahn- Daughters of Eville</a>
            <p>Chanda Hahn has done a couple different series, this one is by far my favorite. It definitely pulls
                you in and the characters are so well written you feel like you really know them by the end.
            </p>
        </li>
            <li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/5uf6xu2s">Gilmore Girls</a>
            <p>Gilmore Girls is my comfort show, I think I've watched it on repeat for at least the last 3 years.
                It's wholesome while still having enough drama to keep my attention, with such loving and eccentric
                characters.
            </p>
